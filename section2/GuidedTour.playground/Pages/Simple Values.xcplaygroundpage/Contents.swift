//: Create a constant with an explicit type of `Float` and a value of `4`.

//: Value Conversion (Never Implicit)
//:
let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)

//: - Experiment:
//: Try removing the conversion to `String` from the last line. What error do you get?

let apples = 3

//: - Experiment:
//: Use `\()` to include a floating-point calculation in a string and to include someoneâ€™s name in a greeting.
